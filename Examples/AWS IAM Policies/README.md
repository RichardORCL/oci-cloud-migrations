# Overview
The example .json files can be used to create AWS IAM policies that can be applied to the discovery and replication user.

- [aws-ocm-discovery-policy.json](aws-ocm-discovery-policy.json) - Can be used directly.
- [aws-ocm-replication-policy.json](aws-ocm-replication-policy.json) - Includes a 'ACCOUND_ID' placeholder that needs to be replaced with the proper Account ID.
